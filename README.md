# NMCS
A Stacked Multiple Classifier System (MCS) with a sample refining mechanism to improve classification accuracy.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.14358/PERS.21-00035R3 

### User Guide
This script was written in python and run with Google Colabs. The steps are self-explantory in the script.

classication results were generated and stored in the author's own Google Earth Engine (GEE) repository. Please generate 
your own classification maps as the base classification results. 

### Keywords
